DCA/BWI to Manchester, NH/Boston from $163/$81 round trip - American Airlines/Spirit
Okay, so if you're looking for cheap, there's a non-stop round trip from BWI to Boston on Spirit running from $81 right now for most of February. But if you're looking for convenient, I would check out early May (1, 4, 6, 7, 8, 11, 13, 14) when you can get a non-stop from DCA to Manchester on American Airlines for $163 round trip. This route regularly runs at around $188 to $285 so this is a solid deal, but you might see it at $120 if you're willing to wait and pounce (rare but it happens).

DCA to Charleston, SC for $117 non-stop round trip - American Airlines/Jet Blue
Deals to Charleston have been great for a while, but this is the best I've seen with lots of dates. Check out the calendar here for departure date options from February all the way through September (with some limits on Friday and Saturday departures).

BWI to Las Vegas, NV for $141 non-stop round trip - Spirit Airlines
The cheapest non-stop is on Spirit from BWI. Sorry. You can check dates here. The best are January 29 to February 11. (If you want a non-stop from DCA, check out American Airlines' options that start at $305 on just a few dates, and soar far far far past that. I would wait and watch that one. They will probably get better before they get worse.)

I ran through these a bit quickly as I'm about to catch a flight from Cairo, but let me know if I can help!

Today is a special edition – based on the New York Times' 52 Places to Go in 2019 List – and is the first in a series. 

I've been poring over the list, and some places are very difficult and/or very expensive to get to (Iran, Falkland Islands!). I'll be highlighting a few places from the NYT's list where there are currently great deals from Washington.

Today's deals are only the domestic destinations. I'll follow up with Europe, Asia, and Africa/Middle East deals – based on the New York Times' list – in separate emails later this week.

San Juan, Puerto Rico - non-stop round trip on Spirit from BWI for $160
This is a great price for a non-stop round trip. Check out the calendar here to find your dates.There are a few departure dates in February, March, April, and May at this price. If you want to avoid Spirit, there are some other non-stop options in United or Jet Blue starting at $260 round trip, but with very limited dates. You can check them out here.

Columbus, Ohio - non-stop round trip on American Airlines from DCA for $159
This a great deal. You can depart almost any day between now and May. After that, the price ticks up to $173 for June through September. Find your dates here.

Huntsville, Alabama - non-stop round trip on United from IAD for $277
This is a great deal for people who like to plan in advance and are looking for a weekend trip. You can leave any Thursday, Friday, or Saturday between February 8 and December 14. Find your dates here. I've never seen a good price like this that's available for an entire year, including holiday weekends. (I'll be booking this one!)

Los Angeles, California (and Santa Barbara) - non-stop round trip on Spirit from BWI for $140
Again, it's Spirit but a super deal. You can check out the calendar here to find your dates - with lots of departures in January and February and a few in March. If you want to avoid Spirit, Alaska Airlines has non-stops from IAD for $197 with lots of date options as well. Find your dates here.

Houston, Texas - non-stop round trip on Spirit from BWI for $120
This isn't the only well-priced flight to Houston from DC but it's the cheapest. Find dates here (departures in February only). Avoiding Spirit, the next best flights are non-stops on United for $165 round trip for select February dates. Check out that deal here.

1/7
There are still a bunch of great deals on flights to African destinations for February and March.

Here are a few:
	•	IAD to Lome, Togo for $611 round trip - United Airlines. Almost daily departures between February 4 and March 31. Check the calendar here.
	•	IAD to Kigali, Rwanda for $560 round trip - United Airlines/Brussels Air. Almost daily departures between February 4 and March 31. Check the calendar here.
	•	IAD to Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania for $552 round trip - United Airlines. Depart on most Wednesdays and Sundays from February 20 through March 31. Check your dates here.
	•	IAD to Johannesburg, South Africa for $683 round trip - Ethiopian Air. This one is a little tricky to find as the price doesn't load into the calendar - and then once you click on dates, it takes a few extra seconds to tell you what it is. (Initially it says "price unavailable" but just give it a second.) Looks like you can depart almost any day in February or March, but try your dates here.
Let me know if you're looking for something specific!

Hi,

Lots of prices in the $400s for European cities today!

Here are a few:

BWI to Madrid for $459 round trip - British Airways/American Airlines
Great flights with just short stops in Philly and New York - depending on which you choose. You can depart any day between January 13 and March 23 - and return on almost any date. Check out the calendar here. If the prices initially look different, just click on one departure in that date range and you'll see the prices in the $400s.

IAD and BWI to Rome for $467 round trip - Air Canada/Lufthansa/American Airlines/British Airways and more
There are lots of great Rome flights (very short stops) in the $467-$500 range right now on lots of airlines. Check out the calendar here. Depart between January 13 and March 24 - with lots of return options. Your date will determine how short your flights are, so you might want to check a few date options to get the best set of flights at this amazing price.

If you like these you might also like these great (i.e. short) flights for similar dates at the same prices:
	•	IAD to Budapest for $492 round trip - British Airways
	•	IAD to Athens for $535 round trip - British Airways
	•	BWI to Prague for $484 round trip - British Airways
	•	BWI to Berlin for $300 round trip - WOW Airlines
	•	IAD to London for $414 non-stop round trip - United
Let me know if I can help you find something!

Hi,

A few for today.

(FYI that I'll be traveling in Egypt next week, so I might not send a daily email, but I will send any really great deals that I see!)

BWI (or DCA) to Dublin for $300 round trip - WOW air
WOW is a discount airline (one that I haven't flown yet), so make sure to check on baggage policies, etc. before you book. This is a solid deal to Dublin for a great set of flights - with a 2 hour stop in Reykjavik each way. There are limited departure dates at this fare, but if you check out the calendar here there are plenty of good (i.e. short) flight options for under $450 round trip. (Note that if you're not super keen on flying WOW, British Airways offers similar flights from DCA for $450 round trip right now, and you should see those and others in the Google Flights calendar link I provided as well. Some non-stops on United start at $523, which also isn't a bad deal.)

BWI to the Canary Islands for $611 round trip - British Airways/American Airlines
Dreaming of a trip to the Canary Islands? Now is a good time to book. For any departure date between January 11 and March 23, you can go for about $611 round trip. Some of the flights have only one stop with short layovers. Some have two stops. Some have long layovers in one direction. It will depend on your dates, so take a look around in the calendar for when you can go. I'd be happy to help you find the best options for your dates.

Thanks and let me know if you have questions!

Hi,  Not much today, but this one is pretty solid:  BWI to Belize City for $389 round trip - Delta So there are usually flights to Belize in the $320 range but they always include a 20+ hour journey on the way back - usually forcing you to spend a day in Dallas or Atlanta. But this is the first set of reasonable flights I've seen for less than $600. (This particular set of flights on certain dates is actually $1700!) Click into the calendar here to find some dates, and then click on the green prices for this deal. There are very few departure dates that get you this fare - about one per month between now and May. 
1/2
Hi,

Not a non-stop but half or a third of the regular price...

BWI or DCA to Rome for $478 round trip - British Airways/American Airlines
These flights come with an hour in Philly on the way there and an hour in London on the way back, but they are a great deal regardless. This is one of those searches where Google Flights may initially tell you a different price, and you need to click on the right date pair for this price to magically appear. Start looking at the calendar here. The prices range from $478 to $495 depending on the dates. Make sure to check the flights to confirm they are reasonable in duration. (There are lots of flights at this price that have a 20 hour journey on the way home, but just a few that are this routing.) Almost all departure dates in January and February are available, as well as a bunch in March.

Happy New Year!

IAD to Seattle for $217 non-stop round trip - Delta/Alaska Airlines
Depart on most Tuesdays and Saturdays in February and on Saturdays in March for this well-priced non-stop flight. Check out the calendar here.

IAD to Stockholm for $348 round trip - Icelandair
Not a non-stop (doesn't seem like there are any non-stops from Washington to Stockholm at all) but just an hour in Iceland each way (which can be extended if desired). If you think I'm crazy for trying to send you to Stockholm in winter, there are some March and April dates available (and lots of dates in January and February). Check them out here.

Let me know if you have questions!
Holly

P.S. FWIW Spirit is having a super sale right now. Non-stop (!) round trips to Denver ($84), Fort Lauderdale ($56), Houston ($82), Atlanta ($56), Boston ($56), and Cancun ($166).

12/31

Happy almost 2019!

A few today:

IAD to Oslo for $328 round trip - Icelandair
This is a good set of flights with just a short (an hourish) stop in Reykjavik (which can be extended for free to a full day if you'd like). Lots of departure and return dates in January, February, and March. Click into the calendar to find your dates here.

Washington to Melbourne, Australia (options from DCA and IAD) from $660 round trip - Qantas Airways
Great price to Australia, lots of time to plan your trip, and only 25 hours there and 22 hours back (which still sounds like a lot, but it's pretty much the shortest possible route). Flights at this price are a little tricky to find, but there is availability for lots of pairs of departures and returns in August and September. You can try your preferred dates here on Momondo. Or just ask me. I've run lots of dates in August and September and can tell you which get you that fare (there doesn't seem to be a pattern).

IAD to Madrid (and returning to DCA) for $574 round trip - American Airlines or British Airways
This isn't the best price you'll ever find to Madrid, but it's a pretty good one for a solid set of flights. You can depart any day from January 8th through March 22. The return has to be six or more days later. Play around on the calendar here.

Happy new year!
Holly

Hi -

I took a few days off while in Amsterdam ($440 non-stop round trip!), but back in DC and catching up with a few great deals today:

BWI to LAX for $141 non-stop round trip - Spirit
Okay so it's Spirit, but it's non-stop, and so how terrible could it be? This fare is available almost every day for departures and return flights between January 10 and February 10. Find your date on Google Flights here.

IAD to Paris for $476 non-stop round trip - United
Pretty great non-stop Paris deal. Departures almost any day in January and February, and some Tuesdays in Wednesdays in April and May. Return 7 days or more later. Click into the calendar to find your dates on Google Flights here. If your "green dates" don't say $476 at first, click on whatever your green dates are and this price should appear.

IAD to Nairobi for $547 round trip - United & Swiss Air
These are pretty good flights to Nairobi (only a half hour more time than the "best flights to Nairobi"). This fare is available for departures on every date between February 18 and March 31. The first return flight that gets this price is on March 6th. After that, there are lots of return options. This one is a little tricky to find, but go to the calendar here, and click on any departure between those dates and you should see the $547 or a $566 price on some dates.

IAD to Osaka for $539 round trip - Air China
This is a difficult route to get a good price on - and I don't think I've ever seen it this low. The hitch (or secret benefit?) is that you get to spend about 19 hours exploring Beijing on the way there (you may need a visa to leave the airport; make sure to check). The way home is just an hour in Beijing. This fare is a little difficult to find, but I found a few dates in March (including departing March 3 with many return dates). Click here and go into the calendar. Choose some March dates that work for you and wait an extra 15 seconds than usual for the results with prices to load. If you're having trouble, let me know, and I can help.

That's it for today!
Holly

Hi,

This one is a little tricky to find. I'll do my best to explain, but if you're looking for a particular set of dates, I'd be happy to help.

Dulles to London for $430 non-stop round trip on United
There seem to be lots of dates for this price in January, February, March, April, and May. Go to Google Flights (I limited the search to non-stop on United). Click into the calendar, and click on any date with a green price (don't worry if it doesn't say $430; it will probably say something like $574). Click on a departure flight, and then your return flight screen should give you the "real" price. Note that for the date combinations I found, your departure and return flights have to be seven days or more apart (but there might be exceptions).

Holly

12/21

Hi,

Happy Friday!

BWI to Seattle for $215 non-stop round trip on Alaska Airlines or Delta
Depart on any almost any Monday or Friday in January, February, or March to get this price. Play around with the calendar here for options. 

DCA to Key West for $190 non-stop round trip on American Airlines
Just a few weekend departures at this price remain for January and February. Check it out in the calendar here. (This direct flight frequently runs in the $400-$800 range by the way.)

12/20

Hi,

First, a Spirit Flight I couldn't resist flagging:

BWI to Montego Bay, Jamaica for $250 round trip - non-stop on Spirit
Lots of dates in January, February, and early March. These are easy to find on Google Flights here. Click into the calendar for dates and you'll see the prices. It's Spirit - I know. But save money on a direct flight and splurge on your hotel.

Hate trekking to BWI and IAD? Wondering where you can get to in under 5 hours from DCA for less than $200? Here are just a few ideas (let me know if you need help booking):
	•	$89 round trip non-stop to Orlando
	•	$121 round trip non-stop to Charleston
	•	$145 round trip to Buffalo (i.e. Niagara Falls)
	•	$149 round trip non-stop to Nantucket
	•	$177 round trip non-stop to Denver
	•	$177 round trip non-stop to Nashville
	•	$179 round trip non-stop to Toronto 
	•	$181 round trip non-stop to Miami
	•	$198 round trip non-stop to New Orleans

Hi!

Here you go:

DCA to Shanghai (returning to IAD) - one stop on Air Canada for $388 roundtrip
This is a great price for a great route. 17:30 to Shanghai, and 16:40 back - which includes a quick stop in Toronto (about one hour) both ways. Find this by going to Google Flights, and clicking on the calendar for departures from February 3-7 (with lots of return options). The prices will initially say they're higher on the calendar, but if you click on any of those departure dates you'll see the $388 price.

Let me know if you have trouble finding this!
Holly

12/18

Hi from Sicily!

Today's flight:

Dulles to Copenhagen for $397 - non-stop on SAS
This is a rare non-stop to Copenhagen for less than the usual $1200 or so. You can get this price by departing almost any day in February, and a few dates in March, and lots of dates in April and May. Go to Google Flights and click into the calendar to find your dates.

12/14

Hi!

Just one today, because Friday.

DCA or Dulles to Dar es Salaam, Tanzania for $549 round trip - United & Swiss Air
What struck me about this flight is not just the price. But that a lot of the routes at this price have pretty short connection times. Here's an example. There are lots of dates available, but the fare is a little hard to find. Go to this Google Flights search, click into the calendar, and click on any departure date with a green price between January 20 and March 6 — and the discount price for the round trip will appear. (Some routes offered at the price are better than others and be careful about airport changes on some of the route options.)

12/13
Happy Thursday!

Dulles to Cancun for $225 round trip - non-stop - Aeromexico
You can get cheaper flights to Cancun on Spirit ($217 or so), but rarely does a "real airline" get this low for a non-stop. I can only find one set of dates - January 12-19, but there might be more if you poke around on Priceline and try a few dates that work for you. Book this special Priceline fare here.

Dulles to Beijing for $685 round trip - non-stop - Air China
This is the cheapest non-stop I've seen to Beijing in a while. But it's a little tricky to find. Go to Google Flights and open up the calendar. Try clicking on February 24, 25, or 26 as your departure date, and you'll see these fares (with lots of return date options). Those dates may say "$985" when you first see them, but once you click you'll get to the $685. After you find the dates you want, you can book directly with Air China.

Let me know if you need help!

Hi!  Without further ado (and before they disappear):  Dulles to Amsterdam for $480 round trip - non-stop - KLM You can get cheaper flights to Amsterdam with a few stops or on a discount airline, but this is pretty great for a direct flight with some options in the spring! This deal is available on KLM for most Wednesday departures in January and February, a few Wednesday departures in March, and the first Wednesday departure in April and May (for whatever reason). Let me know if you need more help with this. (I found them by playing with dates on Google Flights. Here's an example in March. You can book directly with KLM or Delta.)  Dulles to Zurich for $597 round trip - non-stop - United Take a trip to Zurich for this great non-stop price. There are lots of dates in January through March. Depart any day and return 8 days or more later for this deal. Check out options on the Google Flights calendar, and book with United once you find your dates.  Dulles to Lagos for $627 round trip - Lufthansa Lots of dates in February and March (and a few in January and early May), and you can depart and return almost any day of the week. The flights aren't non-stop and there is a 5-6 hour layover in Frankfurt on most on the way home. Find the best dates for you on Google Flights (click here and play around in the calendar) and then book on Lufthansa or through Google Flights (example here). This one is a little tricky to find so let me know if you need help.  If you're having trouble replicating any of this, please let me know and I can walk you through it!  Holly  P.S. If you're searching for Johannesburg in late January through March (lots of date options), there are some great flights for less than $550 round trip on Star Alliance airlines, but they involve 12-16 hour layovers in Zurich or Frankfurt on the way there. Click here and play with the dates if you're interested.

Hi - 

Welcome to my little flight list, where you'll find international and domestic flights at great prices. These are all flights I wish I could take, but you know...jobs.

I'll try to send you only *good* flights, i.e. not terrible connections and not discount airlines. But sometimes the prices may be too low for me to resist. I'll also try not to send last-minute deals.

Here's what I found today:

BWI to Miami for $101 - non-stop - American Airlines
Take a quick break from severe winter weather and head down to Miami on February 4 with lots of return options. Check it out on Google Flights here.

IAD-Lisbon for $540 - non-stop - TAP
You can get cheaper flights to Lisbon from time to time if you're willing to endure stopovers and discount airlines, but this flight is direct, pretty cheap, and leaves you plenty of time to plan. Check out lots of September date options on Google Flights here. You can book directly with TAP, but for some reason you must book the roundtrip in two separate legs to save the most money. Let me know if you need help.

BWI to Denver for $103 - non-stop - Spirit
Okay. It's Spirit, but it's direct. Flights to Denver have been really cheap recently spanning all airlines. Lots of dates for this deal, including some long weekends like February 23-26. Check it out on Google Flights here and play around with some dates.

If you're having trouble replicating any of this, let me know and I can walk you through it!
Holly

P.S. If you're like "these deals suck!" or perhaps you're grounded for a while, let me know, and I can take you off the list. This is my version of an unsubscribe - for now.
