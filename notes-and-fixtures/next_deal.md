- How do we get the next deal? Even ignoring the slug issue.
  - The ids are not all consecutive
  - More important, what are we iterating over for next? It should be wherever we got to the show page from.
  - We have to store a "reference" the next deal, or possibly to the whole array?
- We need to get that from a place where we are in the context of the list. From the index, then.
